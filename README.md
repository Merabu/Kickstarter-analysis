# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
In general, the analysis is aimed at organizing and analyzing data to understand the data and discover helpful conclusions
The purpose of this analysis is to help understand the correlation/relationship between the type of campaign, launch date, and funding goals.
How different campaigns performed to their lunch date and funding goals. How does the lunch date or funding goal affect the performance of the campaign?
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
As shown in the attached screen shoot, the analysis shows that as the goal was increasing the percentage of success kept decreasing until the goal hit 25000 to 29999, where we see a sharp increase in the percentage successful. There was a dramatic decrease in the percentage success in the range of 45000 to 4999 showing no success in this range.
As the goal range increased from 1000 to 19999 the percentage failed consistently increases. It's important to note that there is 100% failure in the goal range of 45000 to 49999
In the range goal of 10000 to 14999, the percentage of failure is equal to the percentage of success i.e. 100% of the goal failed

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
In this in the successful outcome in October.
From January to September there is a consistently failed outcome with a slight increase in October.
Limited information for example in the outcome rang 45000 to 49999 100% failure percentage in the outcome. I would love to know more about what transpired during that goal range

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
